    <p>The SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple was the first temple built in South America (and in Brazil).
      The SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple was originally named the SÃ£o Paulo Temple.
      Latin American members made numerous sacrifices of time, money, and material treasures to raise money for the SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple.
      At the time the SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple was completed, there were only 15 stakes and about 54,000 members in the entire country. Following the dedication, an incredible 41 additional stakes were organized over the next 12 years, putting national membership at more than 300,000.
      Before the SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple was constructed, the closest temple to the Brazilian Saints was the Washington D.C. Temple.</p>
